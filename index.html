        <h2>üé® Creative Elements</h2>

        <p>I'm proud that I'm creative and multi-talented by the grace of God.</p>

        <h3>üñåÔ∏è Sketching</h3>
        <p>
          I love to draw. Sketching is one of my favourite hobbies since childhood. I want to paint the whole world with my colourful palate. Not only painting but I also do paper crafting. Some highlights:

        <h3>üì∑ Photography</h3>
        <p>
          I am a nature admirer. I'm a deep selenophile. I get captivated by the charm of clouds and sky. This is from where I started to develop interest in photography. I always captured the mesmerising scene of nature's beauty in my eyes but I also wanted to capture those moments in my camera as a memoir. Some highlights:

        <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Writing</h3>
        <p>
          I am also good at writings, poetry, proses and qoutes. I loved to write about my emotions and feelings, so I used to write diaries but by the time I was 15 I started to write poems and qoutes summarising the deep essence of my emotions and expressing through the pen. Up until now, I never stop writing. <br/>

          I have my own small booklet of poetry with 100+ qoutes and 20+ poems and some prose writings. <br/>       
          One of my favourite qoutes is, "Poor Rosens have no reason of beauty and knowledge." ~yk <br/>
          One of my favourite poems is, 'Near-Death' <br/>
          <em>Rest in peace, shallow inside<br/>Say half dead half alive,<br/>
          Shrinking nerves narrow <br/>Hollow anatomy left unspecified,<br/> Nightmare or dream so devived <br/>Half on grounds half in time,<br/>Glistening soul with wings white light <br/>Levitate me up in cosmological sight,<br/>Astral feels in constellation<br/>Wondering if we'll lift a life?<br/>Hand near heart, beat full of cries<br/>Watching our dead with pale eyes,<br/>Mere we pass out in deep sleep<br/>Did i came back dispersed leaf?<br/>I call for thee unconscious mind<br/>Wake me up, wake up, wake me!</em><br/>
          One of my favourite writing is,
          'Blacker than black'<br/>
          <em>I went in the blackhole, it refused to suck me up. Stated your heart is already blacked up with hatred and ego's you got in there. You're a pathetic black killer, blacker than me, darker than the hole, lusty and deep, full of sins. For i am just a hole that traps people by the will of nature until whoever in me vanishes is beacuase of its own last breath!</em><br/>
          My other hobbies that are also my talents are cooking, stitching, videography and editing.<br/>
          Lastly, I am well organised and managed and that is the reason how I managed to carry out my co-curricular activities as well as my hobbies alongside my academic curriculum. Studying for knowledge is essential for us but we should'nt forget mental and physical health.
