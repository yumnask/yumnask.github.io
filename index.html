        <h2>üìú Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Yumna Shahid. I am currently studying medicine (1st year) at Shalamar Medical Dental College, Lahore. I did my junior, elementary and secondary(matric) education from SCIL- School for Contemporary and Islamic Learning. I did my higher secondary education (Fsc-premedical) from Punjab Group of College(campus-10). I have always been keen about medical study thus due to my endless passion and a heartiest desire I choose medicine and Alhamdulillah by the grace of Lord I accomplished my goal. Moreover, I'm quite passionate, enthusiastic and determined. Additionally, leadership has always been a part of mine. Conclusively, there is no such thing as I can't in my dictionary, losing is not in my veins and giving up was never a choice for me. So, yes I'll keep unfolding my journey to come and lead myself till i reach higher level of wisdom and success!

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been determined on the path in achieving my goal. I have been a bright student in my School days. I was good in academic curriculum as well as co-curricular activities. I always wanted to pursue the things I had interest in. So, I have stood academic positions along with winning the curricular activities competitions. I have 14 shields/ trophies, 28 certificates and 2 gold, 1 bronze medal in sports. I have also participated in International Kangroo science contest and in HRCA mega events. Well, talking about my college days, there were no co-curricular activities or competitions on which I was really sad about. If there had been any, of course, I would've participated but sadly there weren't. So, yes college life was the boring 2 years for me. Now, I'm in university and started a new journey studying medicine. Looking forward to blast 5 years. These are some of the highlights. <br/>

        <h2>üé® Creative Elements</h2>

        <p>I'm proud that I'm creative and multi-talented by the grace of God.</p>

        <h3>üñåÔ∏è Sketching</h3>
        <p>
          I love to draw. Sketching is one of my favourite hobbies since childhood. I want to paint the whole world with my colourful palette. Not only painting but I also do paper crafting. Some highlights:

        <h3>üì∑ Photography</h3>
        <p>
          I am a nature admirer. I'm a deep selenophile. I get captivated by the charm of clouds and sky. This is from where I started to develop interest in photography. I always captured the mesmerising scene of nature's beauty in my eyes but I also wanted to capture those moments in my camera as a memoir. Some highlights:

        <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Writing</h3>
        <p>
          I am also good at writings, poetry, proses and qoutes. I loved to write about my emotions and feelings, so I used to write diaries but by the time I was 15 I started to write poems and qoutes summarising the deep essence of my emotions and expressing through the pen. Up until now, I never stop writing. <br/>

          I have my own small booklet of poetry with 100+ qoutes and 20+ poems and some prose writings. <br/>       
          One of my favourite quotes is, <br/>

          My other hobbies that are also my talents are cooking, stitching, videography and editing.<br/>
          Lastly, I am well organised and managed and that is the reason how I managed to carry out my co-curricular activities as well as my hobbies alongside my academic curriculum. Studying for knowledge is essential for us but we should'nt forget mental and physical health.
